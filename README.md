### Problem Statement for Inventory Management System

An inventory management system (IMS) is needed to streamline the operations of a company dealing with a diverse range of products. This system is designed to effectively manage product inventories, customer data, orders, and supplier interactions, facilitating efficiency and improving service delivery. The project will include the development of several core functionalities:

- Product Management: Enables administrators to add, update, or remove products from the inventory. Each product detail includes attributes like code, name, category, and price.

- Customer Management: Maintains a comprehensive database of customer information and supports functionalities such as registration, authentication, and profile management.

- Order Processing: Manages product orders, allowing for the creation, modification, and tracking of customer orders, including details such as order date, quantity, and total price.

- Supplier Relations: Administers supplier information and interactions, including registering new suppliers and updating existing supplier details.

- Stock Handling: Monitors and updates stock levels for products, ensuring availability and timely replenishment.

- User Roles: Differentiates access and functionalities across various user roles, including administrators, sales personnel, and managers, to ensure operational security and efficiency.

- Security and Compliance: Implements basic security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure system integrity, including encrypted communications and compliance with data protection regulations.

- Scalability and Integration: Designed to be scalable to handle increased business growth and adaptable for integration with other systems.

Comprehensive documentation will be provided, including user manuals and technical documentation, to facilitate easy understanding and efficient use of the system. The successful deployment of this IMS will enhance the company's ability to manage inventory effectively, reduce operational costs, and improve customer satisfaction.
